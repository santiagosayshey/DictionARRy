Once you've decided which profiles suit you best, the process of importing the necessary custom formats and quality profiles is straightforward.

# Profilarr

Profilarr is a Python-based tool designed to add import/export/sync functionality to the \*arr suite. It offers a user-friendly way to export existing custom formats / profiles, import new ones or sync a master instance of Radarr / Sonarr with extras.

## ⚠️ Before Continuing

- **This tool will overwrite any custom formats in your \*arr installation that have the same name.**
- **Custom Formats MUST be imported before syncing any premade profile.**
- **Always back up your Radarr and Sonarr configurations before using Profilarr to avoid unintended data loss.** (Seriously, do it. Even I've lost data to this tool because I forgot to back up my configs.)

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Radarr / Sonarr

### 📦 Dependencies

- run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.

### Initial Setup

1. Download the latest Profilarr package from the release section.
2. Extract its contents into a folder.
3. Run `python setup.py` in your command line interface to generate a config file.
   - This will create a `config.yml` file in the same directory as `setup.py`.
4. Open the `config.yml` file in a text editor.
   - Add the URL and API key to the master instances of Radarr / Sonarr.
   - If syncing, add the URL, API key and a name to each extra instance of Radarr / Sonarr.
   - If exporting, adjust the `export_path` to your desired export location.
5. Save the changes.

### Radarr and Sonarr Compatibility

- You are only able to import / sync files to the app that is included in the file name (e.g. `Radarr` or `Sonarr`).
- It is possible to manually rename the files to import them to the other app, but this is not recommended.
  - Custom Formats will succesfully import, but will require manual editing to work with the other app, i.e. you must adjust the quality sources to match the other app's naming scheme.
  - Quality Profiles will not import at all, as they are not compatible with the other app. It is possible to import them manually by editing the json directly, but this is not recommended.
  - In future, I may add a feature to automatically convert profiles between the two apps, but this is not currently a priority.

## 🌟 Upcoming Features

- **Lidarr Support:** Expand functionality to include Lidarr, allowing users to manage music quality profiles and custom formats.
- **User Interface (UI):** Development of a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier and more intuitive interaction with Profilarr. This UI will cater to users who prefer graphical over command-line interactions.
- **Automatic Updates:** Implement an auto-update mechanism for Profilarr, ensuring users always have access to the latest features, improvements, and bug fixes without manual intervention.

## Contributing

- I've added a docker compose file for testing custom formats / quality profiles. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the Radarr/ Sonarr test containers. Add your API keys to the `config.yml` file and begin testing!
